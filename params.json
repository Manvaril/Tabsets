This extension does not, and will not, read the contents of your web pages.\r\n\r\n#### History\r\n**New in version 1.2:**\r\n* Better storage method allows far more tabsets to be saved.\r\n* New UI and icon to make it stand out a little better.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
