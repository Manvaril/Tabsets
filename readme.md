# Tabsets

This extension lets you keep all the tabs you have open in a set so that you can open them all again later, even on another device, if you have synchronisation enabled in Google Chrome.

A simple list shows when each set of tabs (a "tabset") was created, and how many tabs there are in each set.

Permissions required are so that the title of each tab can be retrieved. This extension does not, and will not, read the contents of your web pages.

The full source code is available and open sourced on GitHub.

Version 1.4:
* Version shown in the heading

Version 1.3:

Version 1.2:
* Better storage method allows far more tabsets to be saved.
* New UI and icon to make it stand out a little better.
